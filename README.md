This code defines a React component that displays a product card with image, title, price, and buttons to buy or add to cart, including a variant selector that changes based on the category (clothing or jewelry). Since the backend doesn't provide variant options or the exact stock count, I simulated static lists for the selector and a stock count just for visualization. It also disables buttons when the product is out of stock.
